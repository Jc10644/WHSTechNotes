Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

Coding can be seen and used in many different professions.For example if you were to attempt at entrepreneurship in owning
your own business in order to have structered data and give customers a place to visit to get their information you'd most
likely need some type of website for the people to check out. Whoever is coding that website is most likely involved in computer
science getting payed thousands just to do so depending on how big of a website it is. Even something as different as sports can
have some form of computer science involved. Athletes needing to do test for vertical jumps, 40 meter dashes, and checking their health,
need the technology developed from computer science in order to do all of these.

For an ai project I would an ai teaching website for all types of specific subjects from culinary to learning how to change a tire.
It will involve broad and in depth discusssions and breakdowns on videos that showcase the exact motions of what they're doing. For example if
someone wanted to learn how to fry an egg details such as the exact temperature, level of the oven, type of oven, and other ways to cook it would be included
within the lesson. These are things aren't required to do the task but are given to the user to increase the knowledge they need for future tasks related
to that situation.

I truely believe that this is a horrible idea and I can't see how this would make the company any money or give teens proper work experience. My reason for saying this is that people already
play roblox games as if they were full time jobs, giving people the incentive to waste more time on the platform and paying them 16.50$ would be a huge dentriment to their company. Not only that but I could see
IKEA receiving lots of backlash due to not being able to hire enough people due to them literally throwing money out the window to children. They would also be paying people who sit on their behind and play
roblox all day the same salarie or higher (most likely higher) as someone working a 5 days a week 9-5 job at convinence stores such as H.E.B, Quiktrip, and Walmart. The normal salarie for a Walmart cashier is about
14.50$ and employees of this job would be getting paid higher. This is completely unfair and it will be detrimental to our economy.

## Prompt
Create a slideshow presentation that explains variables and their uses for algebra students. Use breakfast as the center theme of the slides.

## Reflection
The results were pretty good and spot on. The slides came out as I expected and if they didn't they give out two other options on what 
it can look like. I think if I was to change the prompt at all I would change how colorful it looks because it might be too playful. I also feel like no matter
what you type into the ai box prompt it will always look like ai and people will be able to tell. I think that prompt engineering could be valuable in future careers because the
more specific prompts get it does stem farther away from seeming like ai. I don't know how long the field could last though because with how fast ai is advancing you won't really
need someone to type up a prompt eventually.
