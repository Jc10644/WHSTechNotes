Coding can be seen and used in many different professions.For example if you were to attempt at entrepreneurship in owning
your own business in order to have structered data and give customers a place to visit to get their information you'd most
likely need some type of website for the people to check out. Whoever is coding that website is most likely involved in computer
science getting payed thousands just to do so depending on how big of a website it is. Even something as different as sports can
have some form of computer science involved. Athletes needing to do test for vertical jumps, 40 meter dashes, and checking their health,
need the technology developed from computer science in order to do all of these.
